## 🔬 Clinical Simulation Experience

📁 [`clinical-simulation-experience/`](./clinical-simulation-experience)  
A visual archive of my work in simulation labs using high-fidelity manikins (e.g., Laerdal, Gaumard).  
Includes:

- Operating room simulation setups  
- Airway and tracheotomy training scenarios  
- ICU and transport simulations  
- Anesthesia and monitoring configurations  
- Emergency BVM and rescue stretcher scenarios

Each image is captioned and organized to reflect real operations experience in medical simulation labs.

🗂️ Simulation Operations – Admin Experience

This repository documents the administrative and operational side of simulation technology—often invisible, yet mission-critical. It captures real-world responsibilities I handled as a Program Coordinator at the Simulation and Innovation in Medical Education department at a university-affiliated School of Medicine.

---

📄 Job Description

📁 job-description/

Includes a role summary based on my responsibilities as Program Coordinator. These documents outline my scope of work, including:

Managing prehospital training registration

Database entry and e-card processing

Instructor credential tracking

Interfacing with AHA systems and simulation stakeholders

Multi-site coordination and logistical support

This job description underpins all other documentation in this repo and contextualizes the operational workflows I supported and led.

📝 Performance Evaluations

📁 evaluations-performance-docs/

A redacted PDF showing a redacted performance review highlighting supervisor feedback, organizational strengths, and ability to manage simulation logistics under pressure. This includes:

Professionalism & communication

Scheduling & data tracking

Collaboration across simulation tech, instructors, and administrators

Event coordination and stakeholder reporting

These evaluations provide concrete, third-party feedback from leadership and colleagues.

---

🧭 Repo Purpose

This repo is part of a broader SimTech Experience Portfolio that highlights hands-on experience in simulation operations across both technical and administrative domains. While most GitHub portfolios showcase code, this space captures the non-code workflows that keep simulation centers running—from scheduling and credentialing to stakeholder communication and quality control.

This repository is one piece of a broader effort to bridge my simulation operations background with XR, software, and immersive training engineering.
