## 🔬 Clinical Simulation Experience

📁 [`clinical-simulation-experience/`](./clinical-simulation-experience)  
A visual archive of my work in simulation labs using high-fidelity manikins (e.g., Laerdal, Gaumard).  
Includes:

- Operating room simulation setups  
- Airway and tracheotomy training scenarios  
- ICU and transport simulations  
- Anesthesia and monitoring configurations  
- Emergency BVM and rescue stretcher scenarios

Each image is captioned and organized to reflect real operations experience in medical simulation labs.
