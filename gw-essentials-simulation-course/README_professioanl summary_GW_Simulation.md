## 🎯 Course Objective

This course introduced foundational concepts in simulation-based education across the health professions. Through five modules, I gained both theoretical and practical insights into designing, delivering, and evaluating clinical simulations.

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered

- Theoretical foundations of simulation-based learning  
- Psychological safety and pre-briefing  
- Scenario design and manikin-based training  
- Debriefing frameworks (e.g., PEARLS, plus-delta)  
- Simulation operations and technical coordination  
- Assessment and evaluation of learner outcomes  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms

- High-fidelity manikins (e.g., Laerdal, Gaumard)  
- Simulation control systems  
- Digital debriefing and feedback tools  
- Interdisciplinary simulation environments

## 💡 Reflection

This course deepened my understanding of simulation as a **pedagogical tool**, not just a technical operation. As someone with hands-on experience setting up simulation scenarios, I now have language and theory to explain *why* our processes matter — from pre-brief to debrief.

It also reinforced the importance of **psychological safety**, **realism**, and **learner-centered design**, all of which I carry into my XR and VR simulation work today.
