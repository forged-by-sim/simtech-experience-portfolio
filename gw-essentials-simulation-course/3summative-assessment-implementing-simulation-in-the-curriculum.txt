1. Which of the following would yield results consistent with Kirkpatrick’s level 1?
==> Physicians complete a satisfaction survey after participating in a hands-on simulation based training activity.


2. Simulation should be considered as a pedagogical approach when
==> It has been determined that it’s the best way to meet student learning outcomes


3. A strategic vision and plan for curricular integration of simulation includes all of the following except:
==> Development of assessment and evaluation tools


4. The theoretical framework 


Guides the vision for curricular integration of simulation

Informs a strategic plan for curricular integration of simulation 

==> A & B


5. Learners are participating in simulation scenarios that require command of factual knowledge and sound clinical decision making. Learner evaluation should be designed to evaluate which domain of learning?
==> Cognitive


6. The simulation educator understands that the objectives of the simulation should be clearly communicated to the learners and limited to
==> 3-4 objectives per simulation activity


7. All of the following are true regarding integration of simulation into a curriculum EXCEPT
==> Simulation activities should be designed to evaluate all 3 domains of learning


8. Content validity is best described as:
==> Congruence between the items on an assessment tool and the construct of interest


9. Which of the following must be considered to select the most appropriate simulation methodology?
==> Learning outcomes


10. One way to help ensure validity in assessment and evaluation is to
==> Align assessment and evaluation tools with domains of learning


11. The simulation facilitator is planning an event during which the learners are expected to demonstrate basic suturing techniques. The simulation facilitator determines that the best simulation methodology to meet learning objectives in this case is most likely:
==> A task trainer


12. Curriculum designers useprogram surveys to elicit feedback and suggestions for curricular improvement. This is an example of:
==>Formative evaluation


13. Fidelity, or realism of the simulation, must be sufficient for learners to:
==> Meet learning outcomes


14. The simulation educator determines that the major components of a particular simulation scenario may be easily recognized and managed in a clinical setting. This is known as:
==> Feasibility
