# 🧠 SimulationOps – Standards, Assessment & Reflection  
**Folder**: `projects-summative-assessment-simops`  
**Focus**: Simulation-based education, evaluation frameworks, and best practices for simulation delivery  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This project documents my applied reflections on **simulation education and assessment**, developed through the *Essentials in Clinical Simulations Across the Health Professions* course (GWU). Each file represents a targeted self-assessment aligned with recognized standards and best practices in SimulationOps.

These reflective activities helped me evaluate my understanding of simulation-based design, learner assessment, safety frameworks, and evaluation methodologies—essential skills for both simulation developers and facilitators.

## 🌀 Reflection  
Through these structured assessments, I developed a more **intentional approach to simulation**—especially around **design justification**, **psychological safety**, and **learner outcomes**. These concepts now influence how I build simulation scenarios, approach XR development, and evaluate post-simulation impact.

I continue to use these files as a **living reference** when planning new simulation activities, refining evaluation rubrics, or aligning XR projects with operational training goals.

## 🏷️ Credential  
Originally inspired by a Coursera collaboration with George Washington University, this material has since evolved into my personal practice and planning toolkit for SimulationOps alignment.
