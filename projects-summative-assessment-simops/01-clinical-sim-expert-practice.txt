Assess progress of the participant/learner    

Develop clinical reasoning skills

==> All of the above     


2. A process-based role is when an active participant in a simulation teaching/learning process is actively involved and participating in the scenario, making decisions and asking information needed.      
==> True


3. Guided reflection allows the participant to

Reflectively think about the scenario and situation

A mechanism for peer review
