Summative Assessment: Mastering Kirkpatricks Framework for Evaluation of Simulation


1. Kirkpatrick’s highest level of evaluation involves:
==> A change in patient outcomes     


2. An example of a change in Kirkpatrick level “outcomes” include:
==> Improved newborn Apgar scores and a reduction of newborn brachial plexus injuries     


3. The value of using a Kirkpatrick level 1 evaluation is that it:
==> Give you basic information about simulation is viewed in your facility    


4. The BEST reason for evaluating a scenario periodically is that it:
==> Allows you to compare the scenario with current standards of care     


5. The specific skills of the facilitator can be assessed by using the:
==> DASH for raters    


6. An important consideration for a scenario evaluation includes:
==> How often it is evaluated


7. A good source of peer reviewed and validated interprofessional scenarios is:
==> Med Ed Portal    


8. The SSH Accreditation Standard for ______________ is a good benchmark for the overall evaluation of simulation program. 
==> Core    


9. A key element to consider in evaluating  teaching and education in simulation include:
==> The training and development of the facilitators     


10. A key resource for finding information about how to document return on investment (ROI) in simulation is:
==> The Global Network for Simulation in Healthcare (GNSH) website
